```

## writing my first function!
as an exampl,e heres a z-score computation
```{r}
x_vec= rnorm(n=25, mean=10, sd=3.5)

(x_vec-mean(x_vec))/sd(x_vec)
```

Now ill write a function to do this

```{r}
z_scores= function(x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("x needs to be numberic")
  }
  
  if(length(x)<5) {
    stop("you need at least five numbers to compute the z score")
  }
  
  
  z=(x-mean(x))/sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}

z_scores(x=x_vec)
```
saying x=x_vec allows you to put x_vec anywhere in function there is an x

does this always work?
```{r error=TRUE}
z_scores(x=3)
z_scores(x= c("my", "name", "is", "jeff"))
```
x=3 doesnt work bc cant compute sd of one number (see conditional function added)
cant do mean of words (also see conditional function we put in for error if !is numeric)
